# About
This is a simple Chrome extension to provide your kids studying at Kings Interhigh online school to see the proper classes schedule according to a current timezone.

# Disclaimer
This extension is not affiliated with Kings Interhigh.

The extension was developed for my kids. So, there is no guarantee that it will supported tomorrow or in a year.
However, I always open to your suggestions in improving the extension and I will try to do it as long as I have some spare time.
